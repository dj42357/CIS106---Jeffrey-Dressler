# CIS106---Jeffrey-Dressler
My name is Jeffrey Dressler, I'm a new student at Harper looking to get my Associate in Science and go to a 4-year college in whatever computer-related field interests me most by then, and this is the first step.
I've always been interested in programming; I just couldn't figure out the first step on my own, so I'm excited to be finally taking a class.
As far as what I'm looking for from this class, I want the ability to do basic coding and possibly figure out what field I'd like to pursue.
I also look forward to using the skills I learn in this class in my free time at home; the idea of finding a new hobby in coding is exciting to me.
