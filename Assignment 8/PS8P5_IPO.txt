###############The Idea of fiddling with a google docs chart doesn't make much sense to me, so instead I just used the #IPO format present in previous problems. I hope this is fine, let me know if I should redo it.

#####Inputs:
last name
district code (I/O)
credits

#####Processes:
count = 0
tuition sum = 0

get name
while name is !="":
  get district code & credits
    if district code = I:
      cost = 250
    else:
      cost = 500
  tuition = cost * credits
  count += 1
  tuition sum += tuition
  display name, credits & tuition
  get next name

display tuition sum & count

#####Outputs:
for all students:
  name
  credits
  tuition

tuition sum
count
