###############The Idea of fiddling with a google docs chart doesn't make much sense to me, so instead I just used the #IPO format present in previous problems. I hope this is fine, let me know if I should redo it.

#####Inputs:
first number (a)
second number (b)

#####Processes:
for c in range(1,19,1)
  c = a + b
  print c
  a = b
  b = c

#####Outputs:
a
b
c (18 times)

#AKA the first 20 numbers of the Fibonacci sequence
