###############The Idea of fiddling with a google docs chart doesn't make much sense to me, so instead I just used the #IPO format present in previous problems. I hope this is fine, let me know if I should redo it.

#####Inputs:
name
salary

#####Processes:
count = 0
total bonus = 0

get name
while name is !="":
  get salary
  if salary >= 100,000
    bonus rate = 0.2
  else if salary >= 50,000
    bonus rate = 0.15
  else
    bonus rate = 0.1
  bonus = salary * bonus rate
  count += 1
  total bonus += bonus
  display name, salary & bonus
  get next name

display total bonus

#####Outputs:
for all items:
  name
  salary
  bonus

total bonus
