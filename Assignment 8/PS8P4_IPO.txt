###############The Idea of fiddling with a google docs chart doesn't make much sense to me, so instead I just used the #IPO format present in previous problems. I hope this is fine, let me know if I should redo it.

#####Inputs:
item
qty
price

#####Processes:
count = 0
total extended price = 0

get item
while item is !="":
  get qty & price
  extended price = qty * price
  count += 1
  total extended price += extended price
  display item, qty, price & extended price
  get next item

average = total extended price / count
display total ext. price, count, & average

#####Outputs:
for all items:
  item
  qty
  price
  ext. price

total ext. price
count
average
