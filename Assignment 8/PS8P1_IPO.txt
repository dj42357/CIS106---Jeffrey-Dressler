###############The Idea of fiddling with a google docs chart doesn't make much sense to me, so instead I just used the #IPO format present in previous problems. I hope this is fine, let me know if I should redo it.

#####Inputs:
principle
interest rate

#####Processes:

count = 0
total interest = 0

while count < 5
  annual interest = principle * rate
  ending balance = principle + annual interest
  display count(years), principle, and ending balance for 5 years
  principle = ending balance
  total interest += annual interest

display total interest

#####Outputs:
for all items:
  count(years)
  principle(starting balance)
  ending balance

total interest
